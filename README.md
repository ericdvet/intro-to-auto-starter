# Autonomous Driving Algorithms in F1TENTH Simulator with ROS

Welcome to the Autonomous Driving Algorithms project within the F1TENTH Simulator, implemented using ROS and Docker! This repository showcases the implementation of two prominent autonomous driving algorithmsâ€”Wall Following and Follow the Gap. Leveraging the power of ROS and encapsulated within Docker containers, these algorithms are designed for seamless deployment and experimentation.

## Implemented Algorithms

### 1. Wall Following

- **Lab 4**: [Wall Following Implementation](https://github.com/ericdvet/intro-to-auto-starter/tree/main/lab4)
  - Utilizing PID control for precise wall following.

### 2. Follow the Gap

- **Lab 5**: [Follow the Gap Implementation](https://github.com/ericdvet/intro-to-auto-starter/tree/main/lab5)
  - Implementation of a reactive control method for improved autonomous control.
